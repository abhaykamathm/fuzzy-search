# Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy Search is a React application that demonstrates fuzzy searching functionality using the Fuse.js library. It allows users to search for items in a list using approximate string matching, which is particularly useful when dealing with typos or variations in input.

## What is Fuzzy Searching?

Generally speaking, fuzzy searching (more formally known as approximate string matching) is the technique of finding strings that are approximately equal to a given pattern, rather than exactly. Fuzzy searching can be beneficial in scenarios where exact matches might not be available or practical.

## Features

- Searchable list: Displays a list of items that can be searched using fuzzy matching.
- Real-time search: Results are updated dynamically as the user types in the search input.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work well on various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.
